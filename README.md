# KNN_Algorithm_Implementation
This project implements a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch and compares it with Scikit-learn's KNN using 10-fold cross-validation. It evaluates performance on Hayes-Roth, Car Evaluation, and Breast Cancer datasets with detailed accuracy analysis.
